<a id="About Me" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>Hello, my name is John Faulkner and I'm currently a senior in my game design program. I've loved video games as a kid. My first console was the NES, but it wasn't until I got a PlayStation 1 that I played games on a regular basis. I enjoyed games so much that it became more than a hobby, it was my passion. The one game that influence me to go into Game Design was Metroid Prime. It was a game that perfectly balanced art, story, and design to create one of the best experiences I ever had. One day I hope to make games as good as Metroid Prime.</p>

<a id="What do I do?" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do I do?</h3>

<p>When it comes to video games, I am a artist and storyteller. I am pretty efficient in 2D art, and have some experience with making 3D art in Maya. I also enjoy writing storys for games and developing the characters beyond a steroetypical scope. One day I hope to write a compelling narative to a even more compelling and fun video game.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
